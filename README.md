# Sport Dynamics
This repository contains spreadsheets from my dialogues with ChatGPT, focusing on value-finding in predictive modeling. All data and insights are derived solely from these conversations, without external sources. Efficient ATP rankings reflect implied metric values. In contrast to team sports, spatial factors can be directly connected to match outcomes. 

**How to Use**
1. Scroll tennis matches on SofaScore.
2. Use the OddsJam expected value calculator to identify tight odds. Odds are considered tight if the expected value (EV) is around -35 EV on a $100 stake.
3. Look up the players on Tennisexplorer.
4. Remove the value -7 from cells B13:C13, unless the entry pertains to an Asian participant (excluding those from the Middle East) competing in Europe.
5. Remove the values -6 and 7 from cells B15:C15. Make a note of these new numbers.
6. Subtract 5% or 10% from the values in the specified cells, unless the participant competes in his home continent.
7. Adjust the three last cells with your own logic from backtesting.
